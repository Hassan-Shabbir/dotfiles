This is one of the most beautiful and amazing advice by the great
scholar Imam Ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullah) sent by Maria, I think we all
need time to understand it and follow these commands: "A friend will not
(literally) share your struggles, and a loved one cannot physically take
away your pain, and a close one will not stay up the night on your
behalf. So look after yourself, protect yourself, nurture yourself and
don't give life's events more than what they are really worth. Know for
certain that when you break no one will heal you except you, and when
you are defeated no one will give you victory except your determination.
Your ability to stand up again and carry on is your responsibility. Do
not look for your self worth in the eyes of people; look for your worth
from within your conscious. If your conscious is at peace then you will
ascend high and if you truly know yourself then what is said about you
won't harm you. Do not carry the worries of this life because this is
for Allah. And do not carry the worries of sustenance because it is from
Allah. And do not carry the anxiety for the future because it is in the
Hands of Allah. Carry one thing: How to Please Allah. Because if you
please Him, He Pleases you, fulfils you and enriches you. Do not weep
from a life that made your heart weep. Just say, "Oh Allah compensate me
with good in this life and the hereafter." Sadness departs with a
Sajdah. Happiness comes with a sincere Du'a. Allah Does Not forget the
good you do. nor Does He Forget the good you did to others and the pain
you relieved them from. Nor Will He Forget the eye which was about to
cry but you made it laugh. Live your life with this principle: Be good
even if you don't receive good, not because for other's sake but because
Allah Loves those who do good."

I am sorry you feel that way. I wish I could help, however I cannot
change your mind from the internet, and so perhaps life itself is what
will change your mind. I wish you the best on your journey to
self-regulate the mind, and, in conclusion, to become smarter, as the
use of incorrect logic -- or rather the underlying emotions employed --
to attack a group of people for no reason other than for them to be a
part of the group is to commit the logical fallacy of guilty by
association. And, even if we assume the stereotype is correct most of
the time, there is a percentage of the time where it will be incorrect.
This is due to the fact that the logic itself is inductive, which adds
to the uncertainty of the conclusion (as you are making a
generalisation). And anyways the merits of a person are dependant upon
their own actions, and even then the truthfulness of a statement is not
dependant on the merits of a person. Anyways I hoped this helped shed
some light on why, perhaps, your beliefs and the underlying logic may
not actually be perfectly sound.

A farmer with a fox, a goose, and a sack of corn needs to cross a river.
The farmer has a rowboat, but there is room for only the farmer and one
of his three items. Unfortunately, both the fox and the goose are
hungry. The fox cannot be left alone with the goose, or the fox will eat
the goose. Likewise, the goose cannot be left alone with the sack of
corn, or the goose will eat the corn. How does the farmer get everything
across the river?
