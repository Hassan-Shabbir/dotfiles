[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, October 4, 2017 at 5:57pm]; could you check your temperature both when idling and when running programs in task manager? if your cpu is in the 80.C range it might be thermal throttling.

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, October 2, 2017 at 2:15pm]; Battery 0: design capacity 5600 mAh, last full capacity 1345 mAh = 24%

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, October 2, 2017 at 2:15pm]; well, it seems my battery is dying:

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 6:54pm]; well that's why they are called archive drives

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 6:54pm]; Oh there's the downside e

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 6:53pm]; though archive drives are very slow

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 6:53pm]; told ya

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 5:49pm]; Lool wow! That's so cheap

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 5:20pm]; and drives usually fail after around 5-10 years

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 5:19pm]; yesterday you were surprised by the cost of storage right? well an archive drive costs \$0.029 (3 cents) per gigabyte with the drive holding 8TB.

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 2:17pm]; 😂

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 20, 2017 at 2:17pm]; I think they really wanna let go of it

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:25pm]; Phone

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:25pm]; Cuz I was recording from my joined

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:25pm]; And u could hear it

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:25pm]; And apparently I was typing so fast

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:24pm]; I did but my friend wanted to hear the lecture because she couldn't make it

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:24pm]; I thought you liked it?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:24pm]; why?

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 4:23pm]; Lol I changed my setting to no vibration when texting and it feels so weird lol

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:16pm]; so I believe it goes like this: you go and use the windows creation media on your 32 bit windows laptop, choose to install 64 bit onto the media drive, then boot from the drive to install 64 bit windows, all the while having a laptop that on the hardware level supports 64 bit windows

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:13pm]; yeah very confusing

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:13pm]; https://www.howtogeek.com/228042/how-to-switch-from-32-bit-windows-10-to-64-bit-windows-10/

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:13pm]; Ik why is it so confusing eh

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:13pm]; https://www.infopackets.com/news/9655/how-upgrade-windows-10-32-bit-64-bit

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:12pm]; though you should backup all files and note which programs you installed

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 3:11pm]; actually you need to get the 32 bit installation media to install 64 bit windows 10, yeah i'm confused as well.

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:58pm]; They did say they could do it I just hate waiting

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:58pm]; Okay I'll go to them after class then

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:51pm]; if they say you don't need it, tell them just in case

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:50pm]; I don't really have the patientce to download it all over again

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:50pm]; ask them to give you a 64 bit bootable drive / installation media

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:48pm]; what!?

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:48pm]; Okay you have an hour lol

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 2:46pm]; oh, well I'll have to research that

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 1:36pm]; The IT people

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 1:36pm]; They said my laptop was meant to run on 64 bit

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 18, 2017 at 1:36pm]; How do I upgrade from windows 10 33 to 64 bit

[Hassan Shabbir];[Sunday, September 17, 2017 at 1:25pm]; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k\_dddKEiPHE

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 1:52pm]; so basically, \$800 dollars down the drain and no upgrade

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 1:51pm]; as the thinkpad you already had

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 1:51pm]; pretty much sums up why I thought you should buy an expensive laptop as the replacement, and even then spending \$800 would pretty much get you the same thing

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 1:49pm]; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtPbYPQLGek

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 7:47pm]; 8:30

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 7:36pm]; ok

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 7:36pm]; ok

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:22pm];

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:08pm]; Ikr that's what I was gonna say!

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:07pm]; you shouldn't have any problems because your laptop passed their recommendations

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:06pm]; ill check with it before i get a new one thi just in case

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:06pm]; ok, I'll see it today

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:03pm]; no, the processor type is unchangeable

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:03pm]; ye but if i need to download the other bit version i think i delete the current then reinstall

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 1:02pm]; no, it seems you already have the full version

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:56pm]; or vice versa

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:56pm]; ohhh okay

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:56pm]; if you got the 32 bit (x86) program try to find the 64 bit version (x64)

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:55pm]; what do i do

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, September 13, 2017 at 12:55pm];

[Hassan Shabbir];[Tuesday, September 12, 2017 at 1:28pm]; how is the laptop working?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 4:10pm]; note the line "mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware"

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 4:10pm]; this is ROM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only\_memory

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 2:08pm]; What does that mean

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 2:00pm]; and it has been configured with windows 10

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:59pm]; the new solid state drive is up and ready to be used!

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:59pm]; good news didi!

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:29pm]; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k7zywli4Vg

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:28pm]; oh and the battery train works by using electricity to power the magnets attached to push the battery through the wire

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:27pm]; And I thought you'd know

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:27pm]; Oh wow! That's interesting!

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:26pm]; wait why are you asking me?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:26pm]; the paper clip I am not sure about, the battery train is, the mixing of the lights is, the spinning top is using magnets to levitate, the candles spinning is air currents or heat, and the water droplets levitating could be from vibrations/sound

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:25pm];

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, September 11, 2017 at 1:23pm]; That's so cool!

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 5:12pm]; Ohh

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 5:11pm]; no, i5 from previous years is obviously not

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 5:11pm]; Ohh OK

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 5:11pm]; intel is the company

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:53pm]; Hmmm okay

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:52pm]; and you can very easily upgrade the hard drive and ram];

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:52pm]; the only thing in your laptop you can't upgrade is the core i5 ( the cpu) without taking apart the laptop and ordering a new whole motherboard

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:50pm]; your laptop will have at least 128GB hard drive, Windows 10, core i5 (2nd Generation), 4GB ram, and wireless n

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:44pm]; 250GB, Windows 8.1, core i5, 8GB, Wireless N, are things in most laptops

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:42pm]; oh and which laptops meet the requirements? pretty much every laptop

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:39pm]; Okay I'll try that this weekend then
[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, September 7, 2017 at 12:38pm]; Sure, but you know I would recommend formatting your laptop before buying another one.

[Hassan Shabbir];[Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 7:29pm EDT]; sure

[Maria Shabbir];[Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 7:25pm EDT]; can u edit this

[Maria Shabbir];[Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 7:25pm EDT];
[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:52pm EDT]; well if you know chemistry well enough, hint hint wink wink

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:51pm EDT]; Isn't here a way to not be so dependant on the products they srll

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:49pm EDT]; I totally agree, though they say it pays for itself

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:49pm EDT]; 600 is too much

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:48pm EDT]; but it says 50 dollars for 12 months, so the 600 dollar price is spread evenly across the year, like those furniture shops that let you own the furniture after a year

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:47pm EDT]; Don't think I can send a link but basically I just clicked on the buy now blue button

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:47pm EDT]; I think the price continues after that too

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:47pm EDT];
[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:46pm EDT]; so \$600 for one

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:46pm EDT]; it says for 12 months

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:46pm EDT]; perhaps they changed their buisness model?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:45pm EDT]; can you give me the link?

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:45pm EDT]; 50\$ per month? I thought it would be a one time payment

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 5:42pm EDT]; we had a conversation about growing food, so here is the link towergarden.ca

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 2:28pm EDT]; I have actually heard of her before

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, February 8, 2017 at 12:24pm]; if it is a general category of positions then no don't capitalize

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, February 8, 2017 at 12:23pm]; if you think that the position is like an official position like Computer Programmer for company X or Manager of company Y.

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, February 8, 2017 at 10:56am]; when writing "field placement position" is anything supposed to be capital

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:42pm]; oh ok

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:42pm]; just think of this 'we asked 12 questions.' I think 'TELL ME WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS WERE!!!!!'

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:38pm]; forgot space after comma on first sentence

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:38pm]; its 102 words now

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:38pm]; ok

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:38pm]; i tried to keep a little bit of everyhting..its a summary

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:37pm]; Our group has conducted 300 surveys in the lounge area at the Pit,in Durham College. We surveyed full time Durham College students during lunch hours. The UPASS survey is about the bus pass that's offered with a full-time student’s ID. The research is intended to help us answer some questions such as: how many students are aware of the cost, how many students want to opt-out, and how many are using it and how frequently. The restrictions are: we can only conduct surveys from full-time Durham College students only in the Pit, and we could not ask more than 12 questions.

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:35pm]; wait

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:35pm]; can you send it?

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:34pm]; its like exactly 120

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:34pm]; ye

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:31pm]; ?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:31pm]; done the summary

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:31pm]; ok

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:22pm]; ok

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:19pm]; aboo said eta around 8:15

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 7:00pm]; thx :)

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:59pm]; ok

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:59pm]; hope this helps :)

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:59pm]; well to generalize I would remove parts like 'lounge area' and the questions that were asked. Also add in the overall result and trends. Also remove how you got the data unless it is like a statistics class.

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:56pm]; its 150 now

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:56pm]; ok

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:56pm]; shorten

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:55pm]; ?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:55pm]; so shorten or lengthen the summary

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:55pm]; To summarize, our group has conducted 300 surveys in the lounge area at the Pit in Durham College. We separated in the Pit in order to survey the most number of students in 2 hours, usually sometime between the busy hours of 11-3 p.m.. The survey is about the U-Pass which is a bus pass that's offered with the student ID’s if the student is full time. The research is intended to help us answer some questions such as: how many students are aware they pay for the U-Pass, what is the cost of it for the school year, how many students want to opt-out, and how many are using it and how frequently and how many are happy with it. The restrictions are we can only conduct surveys in the Pit, only conduct surveys from full-time Durham College students, and we could not ask more than 12 questions.

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:55pm]; how would you summarize this in 80-120 words...

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:30pm]; ye

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, December 5, 2016 at 6:30pm]; cool

[Hassan Shabbir];[Tuesday, November 29, 2016 at 8:11pm]; I just remembered that in business terms the derivative is called marginal so like marginal cost. So my question was do you still work with these sorts of graphs?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:36pm]; if you still don't understand I will show you when you get here

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:36pm]; Ooh

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:35pm]; the first version guessed if only one character was wrong it would make a whole new string, while the second one improved on the previous one

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:34pm]; the one that guessed what characters you typed

[Maria Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:34pm]; What?! Which program was that

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 1:09pm]; so basically the gist of it is that the string 'me thinks it is a weasel' took more that 3 hours to get 10 out of the 28 characters correct in one program and only took one second to complete the whole string in another program];

[Hassan Shabbir];[Monday, November 28, 2016 at 12:50pm]; I finished the program];

[Hassan Shabbir];[Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 10:15pm]; oh

[Hassan Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:12pm]; great

[Maria Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:12pm]; yup i can see that

[Hassan Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 9:08pm]; so basically you can tell how long a program will take to run by looking at the general curve (ie code) rather than actually running it

[Hassan Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 9:07pm]; thanks

[Maria Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 9:02pm]; [Maria Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 9:02pm]; cool

[Hassan Shabbir];[Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 8:35pm]; if you look at this graph you can see how programs behave as the input (bottom axis) gets larger https://therecyclebin.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/time-complexity.png

[Hassan Shabbir];[Friday, November 25, 2016 at 7:31pm]; thanks

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 2:01pm]; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical\_induction\#Example

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:35pm]; lolll ur making it seem like it was years ago :P

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:34pm]; depends on the scope which changes the percentage, you know plain statistics

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:34pm]; good old times when the population of humans was significantly less and all animals lived in peace and tranquility

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:33pm]; me too actually

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:33pm]; i still think its by humans

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:33pm]; LOL

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:33pm]; ohhh

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:33pm]; in this context it means caused by

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:32pm]; good ol' times

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:32pm]; I did math proofs which had things like induction

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:31pm]; HAHAHAHA

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:31pm]; What does induced mean

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:31pm]; [Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:30pm]; Btw most of the problems are caused by humans!!

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:23pm]; [Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:23pm]; So optimistic

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:23pm]; Lolololol

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:17pm]; I find that hard to believe. I believe that you can write better drafts! I have a dream that one day Maria will be able to write essays without much help from me! \*Clap\* \*Clap\*

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:13pm]; okayy i did try hard not to make anymistakes but again it was sort of like a draft that had had the ideas written down...just basic stuff

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:11pm]; open to possibilities of improvement, I was thinking, or from a criticizing mind also I guess

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:10pm]; but it does take time, which is why I want you to work harder on it before giving it to me

[Maria Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:09pm]; Lol open mind or a very criticizing mind?

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:09pm]; it's actually quite easy

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:09pm]; :)

[Hassan Shabbir];[Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 1:08pm]; look at it from an open mind

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 5:13pm]; It's about a program that continues forever, which makes me think if the channel is meant to keep the children busy forever and whether the creators of that channel knew about this

[Hassan Shabbir];[Friday, January 8, 2016 at 12:26am]; No, it isn't. However they don't have any investors and they will break even in maybe the next year or so. Also, no money is made from the non-profits or the users (us) but they do make money (like 1000!) from a single job advertisement. Apparently this is because they are able to find good quality people who have completed fcc.

[Maria Shabbir];[Thursday, January 7, 2016 at 10:52pm]; Ooh I thought it was non profit

[Hassan Shabbir];[Thursday, January 7, 2016 at 9:59pm]; Not sure if I told you but fcc is a for profit company
