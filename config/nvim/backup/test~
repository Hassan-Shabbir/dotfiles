On Saffron in Wine

Saffron added to wine makes you very drunk and foul-smelling as well
as making the wine taste most strange. As there is no receipt which
instructs you to add saffron to wine I am surprised Gaudio Fullente so
frequently offers it to one, but then as he is drunk and foul-smelling
at all times it is possible I am wrong in my condemnation of his drink
and it is he for whom I should have contempt.

Excerpt from Leonardo's Kitchen Note Books.

var foo    = 1;
var bar    = 'a';
var foobar = foo + bar;

one   = 1
two   = 2
three = 3
four  = 4
