How to cook brown rice:


Brown rice is much more nutritious than white rice and makes for a healthy, yet
filling meal. Cooking brown rice is easy and basic, but it takes a little more
water and time than regular white rice. Here's how to do it, using multiple
cooking methods. Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 40-50 minutes Total time:
50-60 minutes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method 1 In a Saucepan

1 Select a large saucepan with a tight fitting lid. A
large saucepan is better for cooking rice than a smaller one as it has a greater
cooking surface. This allows the water in the saucepan to heat more evenly,
leading to a greater level of consistency in the cooked rice. A tight fitting
lid prevents steam from escaping when cooking.

2 Measure the rice. One cup of uncooked rice will yield approximately three cups
of cooked rice. Rinse the rice thoroughly in a sieve or strainer until the water
runs clear. Add to saucepan. For softer rice, soak the grains in cold water for
45 minutes to an hour before cooking. This allows the water to penetrate the
outer bran layers.

Optionally, you can heat a little oil in the saucepan over medium heat and fry
the rice for a moment before adding the water. This helps build flavor, but is
definitely optional.

3 Measure the water. Add 2 1/2 cups of water for every cup of brown rice.
Lightly salt the water with about a teaspoon of salt. Stir once. Other liquids,
such as vegetable or chicken stock are also good for cooking rice and adding
flavor. It is important to accurately measure the correct amount of water or
broth for the amount of rice you’re cooking, otherwise your finished product
might turn out burnt or mushy.

4 Bring the saucepan to a boil. Then reduce the
heat to low and simmer, covering the saucepan with a lid, until the rice is
tender and the majority of liquid has been absorbed. Cooking time will vary
according to the stove used. Brown rice usually takes between 40 and 50 minutes
to cook, however, you should begin checking it after 30 minutes to prevent it
from burning.

Simmer the rice on the coolest burner on your stove, or on a simmer ring. The
rice should be bubbling very slightly.

5 Leave to rest. Once the rice has finished cooking and all the water has boiled
off, leave it to rest, with the lid on, for a minimum of five minutes. The rice
will firm up as it cools slightly, allowing you to serve long, fluffy, unbroken
grains of rice. After the resting period, remove the lid and fluff up the rice
with a fork - it should be light and fragrant! Serve immediately, or let the
rice cool for half an hour then refrigerate for future lunches.

Method 2 In the Oven

1 Preheat the oven. Preheat the oven to a temperature of 375 °F (191 °C).

2 Measure the rice. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of brown rice. Rinse the rice
thoroughly in a sieve or strainer until the water runs clear. Place the rice
into an 8-inch square glass baking dish.

3 Boil the water. Bring 2 1/2 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of butter and 1
teaspoon of salt to a boil in a kettle or covered saucepan. Once the water
boils, pour it over the rice, stir once to combine, and cover the dish tightly
with heavy-duty aluminum foil.

4 Bake. Bake the rice on the middle rack of the oven for 1 hour. After 1 hour,
remove the aluminium foil and fluff the rice with a fork. Serve immediately.

Method 3 In a Rice Cooker

1 Measure the rice. Measure out the amount of rice you wish to cook, usually 1
cup. Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water, then soak for 45 minutes. This
will help to soften the rice.

2 Drain the rice. Drain the rice and pour into the inner vessel of the rice
cooker.

3 Add the water. Pour water into the rice cooker until it reaches the 2 1/2 cup
to 3 cup mark, depending on how soft you like your rice. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of
salt.

4 Turn on the rice cooker. Fit the lid of the rice cooker on securely, plug
it in, and press the switch to turn the cooker to cooking mode. The red light
should be on.

5 Leave to cook. Leave the rice to cook for approximately 45 minutes. When the
rice is cooked, the cooker should automatically switch to "warm" mode. Fluff the
rice up with a fork before serving.

Method 4 In the Microwave

1 Prepare the dish. Add 3 cups of water and 1 tablespoon of oil to a 2.5 quart
microwave-safe dish with a lid. Crumble 2 chicken bullion cubes into the water
(optional).

2 Measure the rice. Measure out 1 cup of brown rice. Rinse thoroughly in a sieve
until the water runs clear. Sprinkle the rice into the water-filled dish and
give it a small stir to combine.

3 Microwave the rice. Place the dish in the microwave and cook, uncovered, for
10 minutes on high power. Then cover the dish, without stirring the rice, then
cook for 30 minutes on 50% power.

4 Let it rest. Leave the microwave door closed and let the dish sit in it for 10
minutes. Then remove the dish from the microwave and fluff the rice with a fork.
Serve.

5 Finished.

Recipe 2
Ingredients:
1 cup brown rice

Method: Put rice and 2 cups water into a small pot and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot and simmer until liquid
is completely absorbed and rice is just tender, about 40 minutes. No peeking
until then; valuable steam escapes! Set covered pot aside off of the heat for 10
minutes then uncover and fluff rice with a fork. Nutritional Info: Per Serving:
